However, by holding onto our dreams and making them our purpose, we find the strength to keep moving forward. Despite the difficulties we face, we learn to persevere and strive towards the life we have always envisioned for ourselves. With a steadfast determination to make our dreams a reality, we can overcome any obstacle that comes our way" </p>
